Award
2017
is
to
be
awarded
to
Fernando
Diaz
Director
of
Research
at
Spotify
The
panel
of
independent
experts
in
information
retrieval
IR
and
natural
language
processing
NLP
was
particularly
impressed
by
his
great
breadth
and
excellence
of
research
his
raising
of
important
issues
such
as
ethical
issues
and
his
service
to
the
community.
In
addition
to
that
the
fact
that
Fernando
has
made
major
contributions
in
both
IR
and
NLP
is
in
the
very
spirit
of
the
award.
Congratulations
and
we
are
looking
forward
to
an
inspiring
keynote
talk
at
ECIR
2018
in
Grenoble!
In
2016
the
award
panel
had
the
difficult
task
to
decide
between
a
range
of
candidates
with
outstanding
research
credentials
all
of
which
lead
an
impressive
research
programme
with
a
view
to
advance
our
understanding
of
IR
and
or
NLP
through
experimentation.
In
giving
the
award
to
Jaime
Teevan
Affiliate
Associate
Professor
at
the
University
of
Washington
Seattle
USA
Principal
Researcher
at
Microsoft
Research
Redmond
USA
the
award
panel
recognises
Jaime's
technically
strong
and
exceptionally
creative
contributions
to
the
intersection
of
information
retrieval
user
experience
and
social
media.
In
particular
Jaime
has
advanced
our
understanding
of
information
retrieval
through
her
contributions
to
design
implementation
and
careful
evaluation
of
new
retrieval
algorithms
and
user
experiences.
Jaime
will
give
a
keynote
at
ECIR
2017.
In
2015
the
award
panel
was
highly
impressed
both
by
the
quality
and
diversity
of
the
field
of
candidates
it
faced
a
hard
time
narrowing
down
the
nominations
to
a
short
list.
Even
more
so
it
turned
out
the
panel
experienced
a
genuine
difficulty
of
deciding
between
the
two
candidates
who
best
matched
the
award
criterion
"To
have
endeavoured
to
advance
our
understanding
of
IR
and
or
NLP
through
experimentation."
As
a
consequence
and
unique
to
2015
the
panel
decided
to
make
two
full
awards.

Jordan
Boyd
Graber
Assistant
Professor
Computer
Science
Department
University
of
Colorado
USA
The
panel
recognised
Jordan's
technically
strong
and
creative
work
on
probabilistic
topic
models
in
particular
how
his
work
has
shown
that
the
semantic
coherence
of
these
topics
can
be
systematically
assessed
how
linguistic
knowledge
such
as
word
senses
syntactic
relations
and
inter
language
relationships
can
be
incorporated
and
crucially
how
user
feedback
can
easily
and
iteratively
be
integrated
into
learned
topic
models
to
improve
the
semantic
coherence
of
the
topics.
The
panel
thought
that
Jordan
has
shaped
our
understanding
of
NLP
in
new
and
important
ways
through
experimental
machine
learning
research.
Jordan
gave
a
keynote
at
ECIR
2016
on
interactive
machine
learning
for
understanding

document
collections.
Emine
Yilmaz
Lecturer
Department

Computer

College

UK
The
panel
was
impressed
by
the
body
of
Emine's
research
on
evaluation
techniques
to
better
match
the
realities
of
modern
information
systems
in
particular
her
work
on
missing
user
judgments
her
proposed
new
metrics
that
are
more
robust
to
missing
data
and
her
work
on
expected
browsing
utility
as
a
new
evaluation
metric
derived
from
interaction
patterns
of
real
web
search
sessions.
Her
recent
work
focused
on
devising
and
evaluating
the
quality
of
task
based
information
retrieval
systems
retrieval
systems
that
can
help
the
user
complete
the
task
that
have
led
them
issue
a
query
to
a
search
engine
as
opposed
to
just
retrieving
a
list
of
documents
relevant
to
the
query
submitted.
The
panel
recognized
that
Emine's
research
has
pushed
the
field
of
IR
forward
in
these
important
aspects
and
that
her
work
has
had
a
high
impact
on
academia
and
practice.
Emine
gave
a
keynote
at
ECIR
2016
on

In

the
BCS
BCS
IRSG
Karen
Spärck
Jones
Award
for
2013
the
Panel
strongly
recognizes
that
Eugene
Agichtein
has
made
several
important
contributions
in
search
and
large
scale
web
text
data
mining
with
a
focus
on
user
interaction
data.
Eugene's
work
has
included
demonstrating
how
models
of
human
information
interactions
can
be
inferred
by
leveraging
computational
techniques
on
what
are
large
scale
but
also
noisy
behaviour
records.
His
work
has
been
very
influential
the
depth
of
which
across
several
areas
is
impressive.
Eugene
has
focused
on
understanding
and
modelling
user
interaction
in
web
search
and
collaborative
question
answering.
For
example
he
has
shown
that
click
through
and
other
forms
of
implicit
feedback
are
useful
for
improving
search
results
ranking
when
gathered
across
large
numbers
of
users.
This
is
one
area
of
contribution
where
his
work
is
seen
as
particularly
influential.
Eugene's
work
includes
mouse
movements
and
prediction
of
responses
to
advertising
and
has
reached
out
to
other
domains
too.
Overall
Eugene
Agichtein's
work
is
regarded
as
that
of
an
excellent
experimentalist
that
recognizes
the
critical
linkages
between
information
theory
and
experiment.

a
keynote
speech
at
ECIR
